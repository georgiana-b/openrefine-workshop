      # Cleaning data with OpenRefine
      ### A step by step exercise on a real world example
      ---
      class: center, middle
      Often times a great impediment in data analysis is the poor quality of data itself.
      The purpose of this presentation is to explore the functionalities of OpenRefine that can
      help us tidy and normalize data.

      We will clean up a real word dataset of public procurement contracts to get familiar
      with these features.

      You can download the dataset from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B58kVdotYLhDaUNQTlVzNVRqRkk)
      or by cloning the [GitHub project](https://github.com/georgiana-b/openrefine-workshop) which also contains the presentation.

      Let's dig in!
      ---
      class: center, middle
      # 1. Setup
        OpenRefine is open source and it's available for all widely used operating systems.
        You can find [here](http://openrefine.org/download.html) all versions along with
        straightforward instructions to install it.

        If you open a big file, OpenRefine might get stuck because the default amount of memory allocated for it
        is not enough. Check [this page](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/wiki/FAQ:-Allocate-More-Memory)
        to see how you can give it more memory.
      ---
      class: center, middle
      # 2. Import
        After you start it, OpenRefine will open in new browser window. Click on `Create Project`
        and import the dataset. There is a list of supported file types from which we will choose
        `CSV / TSV / separator-based files`.

        For this exercise we will make the following changes to the default settings:

        * uncheck `Store blank rows`
        * check `Parse cell text into numbers, dates, ...`


        As you can see in the preview, this last option converts the fields containing only numbers, dates
        etc. from text to their corresponding type.

        When you're ready, click on `Create Project` to move on.
      ---
      class: center, middle
        # 3. Moving things around
        OpenRefine offers a convenient way to move around and remove columns.

        We will move  _operator_official_name_  and  _additional_information_ columns among the first and remove _activity_contractor_.

        To access these options click on `All-> Edit columns -> Re-order/remove columns`.
        Drag columns up and down to change order or drop them in the right side box to have them removed.
      ---
      class: center, middle
        # 4. Transformations
        We are going to prepare the _operator_official_name_ column for analysis.

        .note[.note_text[NOTE:] For all the operations on a certain column, click on the arrow in front of it's name.]

        Because some analyzers are case sensitive we'll make a new helper column from _operator_official_name_
        with all string uppercase and call it _operator_name_upcase_.
        Click on `Edit Column -> Add column based on this column` then replace `value` with:

        ```grel
        toUppercase(value)
        ```

        `value` refers to the value in the current column.
        `toUppercase()` is one of [GREL's string functions](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/wiki/GREL-String-Functions)
        that does what it says.

        .note[.note_text[NOTE:] Always check the preview in the transformation window to make sure your transformation does what it should.]


      ---
      class: center, middle
        .note[.note_text[NOTE:]OpenRefine supports coding in the following languages:
        [GREL](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/wiki/General-Refine-Expression-Language),
        [Jython](https://wiki.python.org/jython/WhyJython) and [Clojure](https://clojure.org/).
        For this tutorial we use GREL.]

        We'll use our new column _operator_name_upcase_ to find different names that refer to the same company.

        But first, we should get rid of unwanted whitepaces. They may seem harmsless until
        strings that are apparently the same are identified as different because
        OpenRefine takes whitespaces into consideration.

        To remove them for all values in the column click on
        `Edit cells -> Common Tranformation -> Trim leading and trailing whitespaces`,
        and then `Collapse consecutive whitespaces`.

      ---
      class: center, middle
        Oftentimes scraped data is left with some unwanted HTML as in the _additional_information_ column.
        Fortunately, OpenRefine has some [convenient HTML parsing functions too.](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/wiki/GREL-Other-Functions#jsoup-html-parsing-functions)
        Click on `Edit cells -> Transform` and replace `value` with:

        ```grel
        parseHtml(value).select("P")[0].htmlText().toString()
        ```

        `parseHtml(value)` detects HTML tags in the value and adds missing tags if any.
        `select(tag)` gathers all occurrences of the specified tag in an array(a.k.a list).
        we use `[0]` to get the first paragraph and `htmlText()` to extract the text from it.
        `toString()` converts the results of the previous function into a string.

        ]

        We'll proceed to the next steps and make more transformations if we notice the need.

        # 5. Cluster and edit (i.e. the juicy part)
        Click on `Edit cells -> Cluster and edit`.
        Notice the `Method` and the `Keying function` dropdowns.
        OpenRefine's wiki has [a page where each of these are explained thoroughly](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/wiki/Clustering-In-Depth)
        and I recommend reading it because it will help you make sense of their results.

        By looking at the first few results we notice two common issues that are easily
        solvable without having to match them manually:

        * some strings have a "." at the end
        * both "LIMITED" and "LTD" are used


        To solve the first one we'd like to select only the names which end with a dot.
        That's what facets are for. Click on `Facet -> Custom text facet` and replace `value` with:

        ```grel
        endsWith(value, ".")
        ```

        `endsWith(value, string)` checks if value ends with string and returns _true_ if it does and _false_ if it doesn't

      ---
      class: center, middle

        We'll select those that fullfil the condition (_true_) and apply the
        following transformation to remove the dot:

        ```grel
        replace(value, /.$/, "")
        ```

        `replace(string s, string f, string r)` returns the string obtained by replacing f with r in s.
        f can be a regular expression, in which case r can also contain capture groups declared in f.

        We used the [regular expression](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/wiki/Understanding-Regular-Expressions) ``/.$/` to identify all "." that are right before the end ("$" matches the end of the string).

        You should see `true 0` in the facet after applying this.Close it and let's move on.

        .note[
        .diy_text[DIY:]
        For the second issue use `replace` again to change "LIMITED" into "LTD".
        You should see a message that 1672 cells were transformed.

        If you get stuck, <span style="text-decoration:underline;" onclick="javascript:show_text_boxes();">see the solution.</span>

        <span id="solution" style="display:none;">`replace(value, "LIMITED", "LTD")`</span>
        ]
      ---
      class: center, middle

        Back to cluster and edit, we'll start with the [`fingerprint`](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/wiki/Clustering-In-Depth#fingerprint) keying function.
        It will help us match names that contain the same words but in different order or with different punctuation.
        Click on the name you want to keep and check the box corresponding to the group
        if you're happy with the match. Alternatively, use `Select all`.
        Then `Merge selected and Re-cluster`.

        .note[
        .diy_text[DIY:]
        Try out [n-gram fingerprint](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/wiki/Clustering-In-Depth#n-gram-fingerprint)
        with `Ngram Size 2`.]

        Moving on to phonetic keying functions, we'll use [methaphone3](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/wiki/Clustering-In-Depth#phonetic-fingerprint)
        which is the one for English. This is very useful for correcting mistakes made
        by spelling words according to how they sound.
        As you'll notice by looking at the results, this function is more permissive.

        To reduce the number of overfitted records we'll play with the facets OpenRefine built for us on the right side.
        Reduce the upper limit of `Choices in Cluster to 3.90` and `Length Variance of Choices to 15`
        by dragging it to the left.
        Carefully merge what seems a good match.
      ???
        Fingerprint assumes that two names have identical alphabetical characters and spacing,
        regardless of capitalization and punctuation. It is useful for matching phrases
        that contain the same words but in different order or with different punctuation.
        Ex: Charlie O'hire/Charlie Ohire/ O'hire Charlie

        Phonetic keying functions make keys from the way words are pronounced.
        Metaphone3 is for English and cologne-phonetic is for German.
        They are very good at matching words that are written differently but sound the same.
        Ex: Reuben and Ruben in English.
        They are also more permissive so I suggest reducing the Choices in cluster and Length Variance of Choices parameters to exclude over-matched phrases.

      class: center, middle
        You might notice that some groups are correctly identified except for few of their constituents:

        .example[
        * THISTLE INSURANCE SERVICES LTD
        * THISTLE INSURANCE SERVICES
        * THISTLE INSURANCE SERVICES LTD, LONDON MARKET RISKS .red[-2 companies here]
        * THISTLE INSURANCE SERVICES LTD. T/A JARDINE LLOYD THOMPSON TENANTS RISKS
        ]
        Fortunately we can workaround this. Hover over the group and click on `Browse this cluster`.
        OpenRefine will open a new tab containing only the rows in this group.

        Now we can filter out the outlier and merge the others. Go to `Facet -> Text facet`
        then in the facet box `include` only the desired ones, click on `Cluster`,
        chose the function that discovered it (`methaphone3`) and merge them.

      ---
      class: center, middle

        We'll now explore the `nearest neighbor` method, particularly the [`levenshtein`](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/wiki/Clustering-In-Depth#levenshtein-distance)
        distance function. This is very useful to correct typos.

        Set `Radius to 1.0` and `Block chars to 6`.
        Merge what you're happy with and recluster.

        .note[
        .diy_text[DIY:]
        Increase `Radius to 2.0` and `Block chars to 12` and check if you can find more matches.
        ]

        This method is more expensive in terms of resources and time so you shouldn't increase the
        parameters too much on a large dataset.

        # 6. Explore further

        You can find a lot more tutorials and advice on the [RefinePro](http://kb.refinepro.com/) blog.
        RefinePro is the enterpise version of OpenRefine but they share most of the functionality.

        If you'll have questions or encounter issues using OpenRefine, they also
        have a [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/openrefine)
        where you can ask for help.

        .note[
        .diy_text[DIY:]
        Go even further with cleaning this dataset by following [this tutorial](https://vimeo.com/17924204)
        on how to reconcile company names with the awesome [OpenCorporates](https://opencorporates.com/)
        database using their API.
        ]

        OpenRefine is a wonderful tool that lifts a lot of the pain of cleaning messy data.
        I hope you will use it and find it helpful.
